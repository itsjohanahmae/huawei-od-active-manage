## Overview
Huawei Active Management, or 华为式主动管理, is a framework designed to enhance the management of Huawei devices. It aims to streamline processes, improve efficiency, and provide users with a robust set of tools to manage their devices effectively. This repository contains the source code and resources needed to implement active management strategies in your Huawei environment.

## Features
- **Device Monitoring**: Keep track of device performance and health.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Receive real-time alerts for critical events.
- **Configuration Management**: Easily manage device configurations.
- **Reporting Tools**: Generate reports on device status and performance.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Navigate through the application with ease.

## Installation
To get started, download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/itsjohanahmae/huawei-od-active-manage/releases). After downloading, follow these steps:

1. **Extract the files** from the downloaded archive.
2. **Open your terminal** and navigate to the extracted folder.
3. **Run the installation script** by executing:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to execute scripts on your system.

## Usage
After installation, you can start using Huawei Active Management by launching the application. Here’s how:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the installation directory.
3. Run the application with the command:
   ```bash
   ./huawei-active-manage
   ```

The application will load, and you can begin managing your devices.

## Configuration
To configure the application, locate the configuration file named `config.yaml` in the installation directory. Edit the file to set parameters such as:

- **Device IP Addresses**: List of devices to monitor.
- **Alert Thresholds**: Define thresholds for alerts.
- **Reporting Schedule**: Set how often reports should be generated.

An example configuration might look like this:

```yaml
devices:
  - ip: "192.168.1.1"
    name: "Huawei Router"
  - ip: "192.168.1.2"
    name: "Huawei Switch"

alerts:
  threshold: 80

reporting:
  schedule: "daily"
```

## Examples
Here are a few examples of how to use Huawei Active Management effectively:

### Monitoring a Device
To monitor a device, ensure it is listed in your `config.yaml`. The application will automatically check its status based on the defined intervals.

### Generating a Report
You can generate a report manually by using the command:
```bash
./generate-report.sh
```
This will create a report in the `reports` directory.

### Setting Alerts
To set alerts, modify the `alerts` section in your configuration file. The application will notify you via email or SMS based on your settings.
